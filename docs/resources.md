## R/RStudio resources

There are many, many resources online for working in R. I have collected a few for you here. I will also give you specific software walk-throughs in the weekly posts.

- [Installing R and RStudio](https://github.com/jaredsmurray/learnR/blob/master/basics/installing_R.md): This should get you up and running with R and RStudio.
- [Installing packages in RStudio](https://github.com/jaredsmurray/learnR/blob/master/basics/installing_library.md): R is more than a single software program; it has the ability to access a central repository of "packages" that add new functionality to R. As of this writing there are over 10,000 R packages in this repository! We will use the mosaic package throughout the semester, so go ahead and install that package following this tutorial.
- [Getting familiar with R](https://github.com/jaredsmurray/learnR/blob/master/heights/heights.md): A quick demo to help get you started in R.
- [Tips on writing code in RStudio's Script pane](http://mercury.webster.edu/aleshunas/R_learning_infrastructure/R%20scripts.html): Tips for creating, loading, editing, and saving R scripts.

Other general resources:

- [R/Rstudio video walkthroughs](https://github.com/brianlukoff/sta371g/blob/master/r-help/getting-more-help.md) The Statistics department at UT Austin has produced a number of video walkthroughs for common tasks in R. 

Working with factor (categorical) variables:
