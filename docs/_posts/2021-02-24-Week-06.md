title: Week 6 (Feb 24)
---

A note for our future selves: Week 5 and Monday of this week were lost to the weather. I hope things are returning to normal for you all!

On Wednesday this week we'll review the basics of fitting straight lines in R and work through a case study. 

##  In-class activities, case studies, exercises, etc for this week

Materials used in class: [Simple linear regression with the Austin Food Critics dataset](../files/SLR.R)

We will work on these in breakout rooms. I suggest having one person share their screen and serve as note-taker, 
or quickly sharing a Google doc so you can work together. All the activities will be a component of the homework you hand in next week.

Activity 1 (Wednesday): [Market Models](../files/ex_capm)

## Readings, videos, and activities to do for next week

For Monday:

  - Read [Exponential growth, power laws, and the log transformation](../files/15_exponential_power_laws.pdf)
  - Complete the following walkthrough: [Infant mortality and GDP](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/infmort/infmort.md)
  - Optional: If you're feeling uncomfortable about using exponential/log transformations, please watch [this review video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhsvqIRWgE8)
  - **New**: Make sure you complete the Market Models case study before class on Monday so we can talk about it. You won't need to hand it in then (you will hand it in later, however).

For Wednesday:

  - Read [Sampling variability](https://github.com/jaredsmurray/sta371h/raw/master/docs/files/08_sampling_variablity.pdf)
  - Complete the following walkthrough: [Gone fishing](https://github.com/jaredsmurray/learnR/blob/master/gonefishing/gonefishing.md)
  
## Exercises and other things due *next* week

Next Wednesday (March 3) you will turn in the homework assigned on the Week 4 post.
