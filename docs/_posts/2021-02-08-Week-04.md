title: Week 4 (Feb 8-10)
---

On Monday this week we'll finish up with the normal distribution by talking about *standardization*, which will lead into our discussion of anomaly detection, hypothesis testing, and p-values.

On Wednesday we will shift gears slightly and start practicing working with data in R through a case study.

##  In-class activities, case studies, exercises, etc for this week

We will work on these in breakout rooms. I suggest having one person share their screen and serve as note-taker, 
or quickly sharing a Google doc so you can work together. All the activities will be a component of the homework you hand in next week.

Activity 1 (Monday): [Sensory testing](../files/triangle)

Activity 2 (Wednesday): [Austin Food Critics](../files/ex_afc)
