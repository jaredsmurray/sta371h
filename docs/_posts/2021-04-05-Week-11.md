title: Week 11 (Apr 4-6)
---

On Monday this week we will review the "Hold my beer" case study and get some more practice with multiple regression for adjustment by working through the "Beauty in the Classroom" case study
On Wednesday we will explore how and when to use *interaction* terms in regression models by revisiting the "Beauty in the Classroom" case study, and (time permitting) in other examples as well.

##  In-class activities, case studies, exercises, etc for this week

We will work on these in breakout rooms. I suggest having one person share their screen and serve as note-taker, 
or quickly sharing a Google doc so you can work together. The activities will be a component of your next homework.
