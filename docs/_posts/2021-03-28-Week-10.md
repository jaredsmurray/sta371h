title: Week 9 (Mar 22-24)
---

On Monday this week we will cover the material about randomized experiments and matching that we didn't get to last week.
On Wednesday we will start talking about computing *adjusted* or *partial* effects of variables that account for potential confounding relationships by using multiple regression.

##  In-class activities, case studies, exercises, etc for this week

We will work on these in breakout rooms. I suggest having one person share their screen and serve as note-taker, 
or quickly sharing a Google doc so you can work together. The activities will be a component of your next homework.
