This week we'll get some more practice using multiple regression by completing the promotional display case study on Monday. On Wednesday we'll start talking about models purely or primarily for prediction.
## Final project information

Overview of the final project: [Project overview](../files/project)

Details about the final project (what to submit, how to write your reports, etc): [Project details](../files/project_details)

Examples of good project ideas from prior years: [Project examples](../files/final_project_examples)

##  In-class activities, case studies, exercises, etc for this week

We will work on these in breakout rooms. I suggest having one person share their screen and serve as note-taker, 
or quickly sharing a Google doc so you can work together. The activities will be a component of your next homework.
