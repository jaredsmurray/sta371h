title: Week 3 (Feb 1-3)
---

On Monday this week we will talk about Bayes rule, or how we should update our beliefs based on new information.
On Wednesday we will review expected value, variance, and standard deviation of random variables, as well as the normal distribution.

##  In-class activities, case studies, exercises, etc for this week

We will work on these in breakout rooms. I suggest having one person share their screen and serve as note-taker, 
or quickly sharing a Google doc so you can work together. All the activities will be a component of the homework you hand in next week.

Activity 1 (Monday): Discuss among your groups the difference between a prior probability $P(A)$ and a posterior probability $P(A\mid B)$. Come up with three examples of events $A$ and $B$ that illustrate how $P(A)$ differs from $P(A\mid B)$.  Note that up to date, we have called the former simply a "marginal" probability and the latter a "conditional" probability.  These are still valid labels, but prior and posterior (i.e., after seeing data or evidence) are more descriptive here. For your examples, how does the joint probability $P(A,B)$ differ from $P(A)$ and $P(A\mid B)$? No more than one should be from your readings. 

Activity 2 (Monday): Work through [the facial recognition case study](../files/facial). See this [(optional) follow up video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfgi9A9PfLU&ab_channel=acluvideos), documenting a real case where police misused facial recognition software to affect a wrongful arrest
