title: Week 2 (Jan 25-27)
---

On Monday this week we will discuss the meaning of conditional probabilities and how they differ from joint probabilities. We'll also get some practice computing joint, marginal, and conditional probabilities from tables.
On Wednesday we will discuss the law (or rule) of total probability and Simpsons paradox.

You will also have your first knowledge check this week, covering the syllabus. I will send a Canvas announcement when it is available.

##  In-class activities, case studies, exercises for this week

We will work on these in breakout rooms. I suggest having one person share their screen and serve as note-taker, 
or quickly sharing a Google doc so you can work together. All the activities will be a component of the homework you hand in next week.

Activity 1 (Monday): Come up with at least two examples of conditional probabilities that illustrate the *asymmetry* of conditional
probability -- that is, $P(A\mid B)\neq P(B\mid A)$ in general. No more than one should be from your readings.

Activity 2 (Monday): Work through [the Berkeley case study on gender bias in graduate admissions](../files/berkeley_case)
