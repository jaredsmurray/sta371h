title: Week 7 (Mar 1-3)
---

On Monday this week we will review the Market Models case study from last time, and begin a new demand modeling case study.
On Wednesday we'll discuss the demand modeling case study and review the concept of sampling distributions.

##  In-class activities, case studies, exercises, etc for this week

We will work on these in breakout rooms. I suggest having one person share their screen and serve as note-taker, 
or quickly sharing a Google doc so you can work together. Some of the activities will be a component of the homework you hand in next week.

Activity 1 (Monday): [Modeling the Demand for Milk](../files/milk)
Activity 2 (Wednesday): [College Scorecard](../files/scorecard)
