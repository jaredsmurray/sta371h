This week we'll get some more practice using multiple regression by completing the gas prices case study and another case study about  the effect of promotional displays on sales.

## Final project information

We will work on these in breakout rooms. I suggest having one person share their screen and serve as note-taker, 
or quickly sharing a Google doc so you can work together. The activities will be a component of your next homework.
