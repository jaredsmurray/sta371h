title: Week 12 (Apr 12-14)
---

On Monday this week we will get some practice working with interaction terms in multiple regression models.
On Wednesday we will practice hypothesis testing in regression models.

##  In-class activities, case studies, exercises, etc for this week

We will work on these in breakout rooms. I suggest having one person share their screen and serve as note-taker, 
or quickly sharing a Google doc so you can work together. The activities will be a component of your next homework.

Activity 1: [Beauty in the classroom part 2](../files/beauty_2)

Activity 2: [Gas prices in Austin part 1](../files/gas)
