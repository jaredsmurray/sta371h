On Monday this week we will get some practice working with interaction terms in multiple regression models.
On Wednesday we will practice hypothesis testing in regression models.  

## Final project information

Overview of the final project: [Project overview](../files/project)

Details about the final project (what to submit, how to write your reports, etc): [Project details](../files/project_details)

Examples of good project ideas from prior years: [Project examples](../files/final_project_examples)

##  In-class activities, case studies, exercises, etc for this week

We will work on these in breakout rooms. I suggest having one person share their screen and serve as note-taker, 
or quickly sharing a Google doc so you can work together. The activities will be a component of your next homework.
