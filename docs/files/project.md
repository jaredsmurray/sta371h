title: Final Projects

For details about the final project like what you should hand in, and how you should structure your reports, see [Final project details](../project_details).

The basic idea behind the final project
is simple: pose an interesting question; collect a relevant data
set; and use the data, in conjuction with the statistical modeling tools
we have learned in class, to answer the question you have posed. Make
sure to quantify any uncertainty that arises in answering your question,
and to address any shortcomings in the answer provided by your data
and analysis. 

You can see some example project descriptions here: [Final project examples](../final_project_examples). 
See also the gas prices case study in week 12, which is based on a previous student project

This assignment is purposely open-ended, allowing you
considerable freedom to follow a path dictacted by your own intellectual
curiosity. You will be evaluated both on the technical correctness
and the overall intellectual quality of your presentation. A thoughtful analysis
of a well-posed question using a carefully chosen dataset and appropriate methods
is more important than engaging in fancy analysis or complicated data collection.
That said, creative data collection efforts will be rewarded!

Where can one find data? Everywhere! These websites in particular
are good resources:

- [https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
- [https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets)
- [http://stats-for-change.github.io/data.html](http://stats-for-change.github.io/data.html)

If you want to branch out even further, hereâ€™s a short list
of other sources you might consider: major newspapers, the U.S. Census,
the Federal Reserve, academic journals, the Economist, Twitter, the
World Bank, ESPN.com or other sports sites, Craigslist, Amazon prices,
EBay, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Facebook, the World Economic Forum,
the OECD Factbook, the CIA World Factbook, the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Yahoo Finance, Google Public Data Explorer,
your own vital signs, your own experiment or survey, your favorite
blogs, your other classes, and your friends. If you know how to write
code that will scrape a website, your options are almost limitless
here.
