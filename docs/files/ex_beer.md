### Hold my beer

For this exercise, you'll need to download [beer.csv](../data/beer.csv). You have
data collected from MBA students at UT measuring five variables:

1. nbeer: The number of beers the student reported they could drink before getting drunk.
2. weight: Weight of the student (pounds)
3. height: Height of the student (inches)
4. age: The age of the student (years)
5. gender: The student's reported gender (1 for female, 0 for male)

We'll focus on the first three.

1. Make a scatterplot of nbeer and height. Does there seem to be a relationship between
height and beer-drinking ability?

2. Fit the simple linear regression of nbeer on height and get a confidence interval for the
slope. What do you conclude about the relationship between nbeer and height?

3. Fit the multiple lienar regression of nbeer on height and weight and get a 95\% confidence
interval for each of the regression coefficients. How does the regression coefficient
on height in this model compare to the coefficient on height in the model from part 2?
Explain the difference.

4. Do you think it makes sense to remove height from the model in part 3? Why or why not?
